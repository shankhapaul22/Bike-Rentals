# Context

Many American cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities. The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.

Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto compiled this data into a CSV file, which you'll be working with in this project. The file contains 17380 rows, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day. It is included in the files as `bike_rental_hour.csv`.

# Objective

We will create a model to predict the number of bikes people rented in a given hours. We will predict the `cnt` column (the target) using all of the other columns as features, except for `casual` and `registered`.
